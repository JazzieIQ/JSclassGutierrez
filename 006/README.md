Week 6
Copying code -
    I don't mind copying code all that much. Being able to reverse engineer existing code has allowed me to figure out what sections and lines of code actually affected. It was different and very refreshing as one of the reasons why I never got into web based coding before is becuase I had no clue where to find resources to learn. Having code to work through in reverse has made learning code functionality muich easier for me.
Current Event -
    I'm acutally taking CIT-63 at the same time as CIT -93. That wasn't my original plan but that's just the way classes worked out because I registered rather late durinng registration. I've already found I am less familiar with Java than I'd like to be so I will pause my workflow as I discover i need to go back and learn something.
Looking ahead -
    This semester is stil early enough I think that making the transition to a new teaching style will be ok. I'm look forward to the change!
