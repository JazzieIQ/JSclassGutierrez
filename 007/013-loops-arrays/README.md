# Week 7
# Are you using devTools?
Why yes I use Google Chrome inspect features. I have used it to look at HTML and CSS elements and am currently picking up how to look at .js files in it now.

I have a full working game. You can have multiple attemps and the div output will append with every attempt showing a funny quote or saying you are doomed. You can also reset the code to empty the div and start fresh.

I started with your original code from video one with commmit update to dom.

However in the first video we were instructed to change the code to fit our understanding of updating the DOM. So I did but it was obvious I went to a farther degree again. By the time I started the second video my code was too distinct from the mileage function.

However I believe my code meets these assingments parameters. As i did not stray away from updating the DOM in div id= "output".
Additonally I created a function that asks for user inout via a prompt, I did try using input HTML but I didnt want to divet atention away from my js.file. This commit point should reflect the "writing mileage function" commit.

Also once I finished my code where user input function inputs text via "p" through the updateDom code. I console an ever updating array of text that changes based on user input. my array function will rewrite and increae with every attempt by my user. This portion of code should reflect "learning about arrays" portion.

Lastly I had to fix numerous issues as you can find through out my code where I had to comment out code in varying states of completeness."fixing issues".
