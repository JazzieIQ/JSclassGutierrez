# Week 8

I have used forms and seen  validation issues. My code actually had similar issues as I needed to removed caps. So correct answers were not seen as valid because they were not typed in caps for caps as well required punctuation etc. I intend to add a filter and remoove caps from user input to make it more functional for my user.

Thus far all my code executes on my event listener via my submit button which lable and give id "replay" and to the user it shows attempts.
