# Week 8

I have noticed that while and do-while are similar but can serve different functions in place of if-else. The condtions appear not to require a boolean but i could be wrong there. In any case while shows the condition to be met first for a loop operation and do-while is the reverse as it gives the loop statement first before conditions are met. in other words Do-While can be used while something remains true and while can be used when something is true. in the order of code this could mean quick a bit of under the hood operation between lopp statement and condition so the choice can matter it appears. I noticed in my code I could get a do-while operation working but while was able to replace my for-loop.

I have used forms and seen  validation issues. My code actually had similar issues as I needed to removed caps. So correct answers were not seen as valid because they were not typed in caps for caps as well required punctuation etc. I intend to add a filter and remoove caps from user input to make it more functional for my user.

Thus far all my code executes on my event listener via my submit button which lable and give id "replay" and to the user it shows attempts.
