In consideration of what OOP is and using class to instantiate objects classes by defintion are a more general concept than objects. Classes are blueprints of objects. So they help to organize code by grouping related attributes and methods together. We used a class to create a new person defined object.

I understand that prototype is a property that is used to create objects. It is an object itself that contains properties and methods that are accessible to all objects via the inheretience concept. Where a child class inherits all the properties and methods from its parent class. The prototype property is used primarily for inheritance; you add methods and properties on a function's prototype property to make those methods and properties available to instances of that function.

I believe I fixed the undefined issues I had and can get and set person and student. Tested in Live Server and everything is working. I understand how to use getters and setters as it applies to inheritance and "object blueprints" but I wonder what the code look like under the hood for these Higher Order Functions. Getters and Setters I believe are Higher Order Functions so perhaps they are just a new norm as they appear to be reserved termonilogy when using JS.
