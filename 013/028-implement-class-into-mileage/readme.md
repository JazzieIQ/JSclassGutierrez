My thought would be to place My_DATA into a class as it appears this is where it was leading to run a few arthimatic operations from some number literals and return a an object. I would then call the class and pass the values to the class and return the object. I would pass the MY-Data returned object to render the table from that object.

I would implement Trip wherever TrackMPGAndTripCost was before. I would then call the Trip class and pass the values to the class and return the object. I would pass the Trip returned object to render the table from that object.

The averages no longer are coming back as a number for my code. My calculate AVerage function was the fiorst area. After going back and recoding along then I ran into a breakage in the render.
