hi my decision logic shows an attempt to get user input and pass it to validation for strictly alpha letters. i do use the update dom function and uer input will append the dom and provide a response. My validation is for a greeting or at least a word of phrase. My validation does not work fully yet alrthoug ironically it does not cause runtime exceptions even my user input passes to a function via an if-else with "||" conditions. the user will get a repsonse on submitting their greeting but since everything is getting passed as a string including I havent solved this issues yet even though i have tried several numeric and/or alpha filtering methods.
